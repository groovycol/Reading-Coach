        <h2>Congratulations!</h2>
        <h3>
        <span>You've just signed up to stay on track with summer reading! You should receive a one-time welcome text message (sent to: {{ session["coach"] }} ) from us shortly. Add the incoming number to your address book as "The Reading Coach". (If you opted to receive text message reminders, you will receive them twice a week) 
        <strong><p>You can view your <a href="/dashboard">reader's progress</a> at anytime, and you can log reading minutes in 2 ways: </p> </strong>
        </span>
        <br>
        <ol>
        <li><strong><p> With your phone:</p></strong>
        <span>You can log minutes by sending a text message to: 510-241-3633. Include the word "log", the number of minutes, your reader's name, and you can optionally include the book title.</p>
        <p>Example 1: <strong>log 10 {{ first_name }}</strong> will add a reading log entry of 10 minutes for {{ first_name }} today</p>
        <p>Example 2: <strong>log 15 {{ first_name }} Harry Potter</strong> will add a reading log entry of 15 minutes for {{ first_name }} for today and add the title Harry Potter to the reading list.</p>
        </span></li>
        <br>
        <strong><li><p> Here on the Reading Coach App:</p></strong>
        <span>You can start recording <a href="./record">reading minutes</a> right away!
            <p>You can also record for multiple days, starting from the day you signed up (today!). So if you miss several days due to vacation, you can catch up online.</p>
        </span><br></li>
